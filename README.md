# SENG 474 Project

# Project Requirements
Since COVID-19 has spread out wildly through the world, each country has implemented
different government responses to defend against the virus. However the goal for each
government is the same, which is to reduce the number of COVID-19 cases and the ability for
the virus to spread through its population. Governments can be more efficient and place their
resources more precisely if they know which combination of responses have the greatest
chance to be effective in reducing spread. Therefore, our goal for this project has been to
create a machine learning program that can accurately predict if a set of government response
measures will lead to an increase or (preferably) a decrease of COVID-19 cases.
To achieve this goal, we collected our test and train data from Oxford University[1] and
Worldometers[2] who have been tracking COVID-19 since the beginning of itâ€™s outbreak at
the beginning of 2020. Using this data, we ran several tests on different machine learning
models while tuning hyperparameters to determine which methods give the highest
classification accuracy.
